As my first personal project, I chose to create a website that talks about my experiences in study and work, as well as my passions.

I wanted to create a virtual space capable of telling something about me, going beyond skills and CV.

This desire arose from the reflection of being a story. <br/>
For me, every human being is a story: made up of experiences, emotions, and lived moments. All unique and unrepeatable.

## SSG

I developed this site using the SSG (Static Site Generation) pattern.

Thanks to this pattern, the pages are generated as static files at build time, rather than being dynamically generated with each user request.

This approach offers the following advantages: performance optimization, security, maintenance, SEO and accessibility.
